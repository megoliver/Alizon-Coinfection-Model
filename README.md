# Multiple-Infection-model

Working on the multiple infection model. Van Baalen & Sabelis (1995) adapted by Alizon (2013) in his review paper.

These files contain the code that allows the user to plot population dynamics for both the resident and mutant parasite strain. 
The time course for the resident parasite strain is named 'Resident Dynamics' and the file for the mutant is named 
'Mutant Dynamics'. For the resident there are time courses for the coexistence case, the disease free case and the one infection present case.

There is also code that will allow the user to produce two colour coexistence plots for each of the three cases above. This code varies each possible pair of model 
parameters simultaneoulsy to see whetehr the particular pair of values allow for coexistence or not. These files are all named in the same way. 
'Coexistence Plot - [parameter name]' represents the two colour plots in the coexistence case.
'Coexistence Plot - Disease Free - [parameter name]' represents the two colour plots in the disease free case.
'Alizon Model #6 -  Coexistence Plot - One Infection - [parameter name]' represents the two colour plots in the only one infection present case.
